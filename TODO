0.7:
    [DONE] * make new functions from 0.7rc optional

Old Todo-list (may be outdated, haven't checked yet)

    * Integrate new workspace grid.

    * Tooltip for workspace name.

    * Write small name into windows.

    * Allow dragging one of multiple window copies to a different workspace,
      eliminating it if already present on destination.

    * Implement own viewport frame dashing, such that it alternates on
      neighbouring lines.

    * Use better graphics library to highlight the viewport by making it n%
      lighter (negative: darker).

    * Scroll viewports and workspaces with mouse wheel(s).  Maybe viewport
      columns top to bottom, then left to right, then on to next workspace in
      same order?
