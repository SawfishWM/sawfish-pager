** Overview **

Sawfish-pager gives:
* the thumbnail view of your entire desktop, including currently off
  workspaces.
* a shortcut. By a single click, you can go to another (distant)
  workspace, or to a window there. You can also move or raise / lower
  a window.

Sawfish-pager is written in both C and lisp.

For installation instruction, read the file "INSTALL".

** Components **

Sawfish pager consists of a lisp file "pager.jl" and an executable
"pager".
