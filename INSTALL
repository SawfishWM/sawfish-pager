NOTES:

A)

You need either version 1.3.5.1 (or older) of sawfish, or 1.5.0svn revision 4370.

Older svn revisions of 1.5.0 will not work, because sawfish.pc is missing two values
here: libexecdir and sawfishhosttype

B)

If you use sawfish 1.3.5.1 (or older) you need to have sed and gawk installed, too.

C)

There's no proper way to figure out the libexecdir of sawfish >= 1.3.5.1, so it's a guess.

If you didn't change the libexecdir of sawfish explicitly everything is ok, else adjust the Makefile. 

Default is ($prefix/libexec/sawfish/$version/$host/ eg /usr/libexec/sawfish/1.5.0/i686-pc-linux-gnu/)

INSTALLATION:

make
make install
