     * Indifferent pager fix
       Pager did not respond to clicks / print tooltip if you require

Version 0.7.2 (2010-01-08, Teqnology)

     * sawfish-pager now depends on Sawfish 1.6.1 as we do now include the
       sawfish-client header directly

     * sawfish-pager now depends on librep 0.90.5 as it fixes the issue that
       users don't see strings from pager.jlc in sawfish-config, while they
       do from pager.jl

     * majorly revised Makefile

     * the following defines are no longer valid:
		+ USE_SAWFISH_LIBCLIENT
		+ HAVE_GTK2
       they are hardcoded to be default from now on.
       the frameover feature is still optional and can be enabled by passing
		-DFRAMEOVER
       to `make'.

     * sawfish.pc is now beeing used to detect which imageloader
       (gdk-pixbuf-xlib or imlib1) to use (-DHAVE_GDK_PIXBUF is set
       accordingly)

     * Fixed a bug where the pager doesn't display windows in the proper viewport
       [Jeremy Hankins]

Version 0.7.1 (2009-12-15, Cosmosonic)

     * sawfish-pager gets the colors to use from sawfishs color-rgb function,
       unfortunately sawfish-pager expects no alpha value, while sawfish does
       send one. from this version on sawfish-pager strips off the alpha value.

       Problems with having sawfish-pager not using the color you have set will
       be gone now. [Jeremey Hankins]

Version 0.7a (2009-12-12, Aurus)

     * make Makefile differ between Sawfish 1.5x and 1.6x
       fixes installation for Sawfish 1.6x which moved from
       $prefix/libexecdir to $prefix/libdir (Christopher Bratusek)

     * added debian packaging scripts (Christopher Bratusek)

Version 0.7 (2009-02-28, Mayday - Judgement Day)

    * Draw windows using hatching, to make them not obscure each other
      (Janek Kozicki)

    * Mark current viewport with "X" (Janek Kozicki)

    * Make hatching and x-mark optional (Johan Bockgård)

    * Respect WINDOW_SKIP property (Janek Kozicki)

    * Merge stock patches from Debian (Janek Kozicki)

    * Added install, uninstall and private-uninstall targets to Makefile
      (Christopher Bratusek)

    * Removed checks for deprecated versions, just check if sawfish.pc exists 
      or not (and do checks accordingly) (Christopher Bratusek)

    * Splitt off NEWS and TODO from README, add INSTALL and COPYING
      (Christopher Bratusek)

Version 0.6 (2002-12-21, Nicolae Ceausescu - Ultima cuvintarea 1989)

    * Moving windows in pager immediately affects real window.

    * Sticky windows can no longer be dragged off-screen where sawfish can't
      get them back.

    * Can now act as a Gtk plugin, by supplying the id of the window to plug
      to.  (Thanks to Andreas Büsching)

    * Simpler installation.  The pager executable is now also found by default
      in ~/.sawfish.

    * Sawfish version now recognized automatically, including fake Read Hat
      2.0.pre1.  (Thanks to Juho Snellman)

    * Three more late display updates removed.  Late display when sliding
      however is a sawfish bug (upto 1.2 inclusive), fixed with an included
      patch not yet applied to sawfish CVS.

    * Pager is again restartable.

    * The stop argument to pager is now moved to second position.


Version 0.5a (2002-11-20, Nürnberg anti-Nazi trials 1945)

    * Handles new colour scheme when compiled for sawfish 1.2.  (Thanks to Tim
      Lee)

    * Eliminated "late display" when some things change.  Late display when
      (un-)shading however is a sawfish bug (upto 1.2 inclusive), fixed with
      an included patch not yet applied to sawfish CVS.

    * Moving and resizing of windows gets displayed as it happens.

    * Buffered input saves many system calls and lookahead reading eliminates
      multiple susccessive window redraws.

    * Require GNU make.  Automatically detect GTK2 (make GTK1=1 to override.)
      Free choice of compiler and options.

    * Don't hog CPU when sawfish crashes.


Version 0.4a (2002-09-11, who the hell are Osama and George?)

    * Optionally paint your own pager.

    * Optionally support GTK2.  (Thanks to Rui Miguel Seabra)

    * Make pager be skipped on taskbar as soon as corresponding GTK2 bug is fixed.

    * Don't frame over current viewport if you have only one.


Version 0.3 (2002-07-14, mourning the end of pluralism in France)

    * Two bugfixes (pager size and phantom window on empty pager) relevant if
      you only display the current workspace in the pager.



Version 0.2 (2002-07-11)

    * Workspace boundaries are now drawn between workspaces, rather than
      inside the left and top.  Hence they no longer react to the mouse.  This
      makes window positions and sizes more consistent.

    * Viewport (if you use this neat feature) boundaries are now drawn as
      light frames inside each viewport, as there is conceptually no space
      between viewports where a line could be drawn.  Since GDK's dashed lines
      are a bit heavy when you have two side by side, a one pixel border is
      left around the frames.

    * When dragging a window onto a workspace boundary, it goes to the
      workspace on which the mouse button is released, not where its top left
      corner is.

    * If windows extend beyond the workspace, through clipping they now have
      no frame on that side.  This also allows dragging windows with a frame
      of their actual size, rather than only the visible portion.

    * Redundant commands are identified through caching, reducing interprocess
      communication and redrawing.

    * Remove -DFRAMEOVER from the Makefile to eliminate the dashed line frame
      that goes above the windows.


Version 0.1 (2002-04-12)

This is a complete reimplementation of spager 0.16, without the bugs, and with new features:

    * Current viewport gets framed over all else, so you can see it even when
      it's fully covered.  (Satyaki, author of spager, feels this should be a
      user option.  Anybody else for that?)

    * viewport gets displayed properly even when it's not aligned to multiple
      of screen dimensions (as is easily achieved with my move-viewport
      patch.)

    * ignoreds are by default omitted

    * viewports are by default proportional to your screen

    * copies are, and stickies can be shown on every workspace and/or viewport

    * pager-show-all-workspaces works properly

    * click on window will focus that by default

    * click anywhere can optionally warp pointer to corresponding spot

    * last row and column are as big as others

    * Result of "Send window to/Copy to previous or next" now gets shown
      immediately

    * pager-executable defaults to be in sawfish-exec-directory

    * replaced merlin/fancy-message with standard tooltips

    * also show button bindings when generally enabled

    * avoid tooltip flicker

    * streamlined code (lisp is only 1/2 and C 3/4 the size of spager's)

    * use define-structure, keeping most symbols out of the global namespace

    * make dependencies between customization options explicit
