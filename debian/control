Description: A pager for the Sawfish window manager
 A pager is a map of your desktop. As maps go, it shows not only the visible
 part (your current viewport), but if you are so configured, also the parts
 that extend beyond the sides of your screen. Also, if you have more than
 one workspace, the pager will follow you to where you are, or optionally
 show all workspaces at once. Of course you can select viewports and
 windows, and also move or raise/lower the latter.
